    ARIMA models rely on the assumption that the time series being modeled is stationary.
    Therefore that assumption needs to hold if you want to use these models.
    The ARIMA model uses differenced data to make the data stationary, which means thereâ€™s a consistency of the data over time.
    This function removes the effect of trends or seasonality, such as market or economic data. We make the data stationary only in case of ARIMA because the ARIMA model looks at the past data to predict future values.
